## Highlights
Much of my time was spent learning everything **Prismic** and how it interacted with Next.JS in creating a custom web app. Where I did encounter the most difficulty was when I was trying to make it a Progressive Web App(PWA). I love the idea of an app that feels like something you would natively install through an app store but who's infrastructure is that of a web app! It was however slightly tedious getting myself to understand all of the requirements to make an app turn into a PWA. But now after some time I was able to get to that point!
